FTL Rust Demangler is a command-line tool for demangling symbol names that are mangled with the Rust convention. It takes a mangled symbol name as input and returns the demangled name.

# Build
To build Rust Demangler, you'll need to have Rust installed on your system. Once you have Rust installed, you can use Cargo to build it

```sh
cargo build --release
```

# Usage

To use Rust Demangler, simply run the tool with a mangled symbol name as an argument:

```sh
rs-dml first_symbol [second_symbol [...]]
```

# Example


```sh
rs-dml '_ZN59_$LT$core..fmt..Arguments$u20$as$u20$core..fmt..Display$GT$3fmt17h03d70cf32f8d87a3E'
```
This will output the demangled symbol name:

```sh
<core::fmt::Arguments as core::fmt::Display>::fmt
```
